# Gokeytype

Todo:

- [ ] Count the correct and incorrect and derive the accuracy from there (the
  accuracy should be a percent)

- [ ] (this will be iterative) Have a word counter of words completed -> then
  also keep track of the words that were fully correct -> start / end a timer 
  alongside the test, then use this for the wpm
